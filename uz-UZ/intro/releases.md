# beego 1.3.0
Hi guys! After the hard working for one month, we are so excited to release beego 1.3.0. We brought many useful features. [Upgrade notes](http://beego.me/docs/intro/upgrade.md)

#### The brand new router system
We rewrote the router system to tree router. It improved the performance significantly and supported more formats.

For the routers below:

    /user/astaxie
    /user/:username

If the request is `/user/astaxie`, it will match fixed router which is the first one; If the request is `/user/slene`, it will match the second one. The register order doesn't matter.

#### namespace is more elegant
`namespace` is designed for modular applications. It was using chain style similar to jQuery in previous version but `gofmt` can't format it very well. Now we are using multi parameters style: (The chain style still works)

```
ns :=
beego.NewNamespace("/v1",
    beego.NSNamespace("/shop",
        beego.NSGet("/:id", func(ctx *context.Context) {
            ctx.Output.Body([]byte("shopinfo"))
        }),
    ),
    beego.NSNamespace("/order",
        beego.NSGet("/:id", func(ctx *context.Context) {
            ctx.Output.Body([]byte("orderinfo"))
        }),
    ),
    beego.NSNamespace("/crm",
        beego.NSGet("/:id", func(ctx *context.Context) {
            ctx.Output.Body([]byte("crminfo"))
        }),
    ),
)
```
For more information please check [namespace](http://beego.me/docs/mvc/controller/router.md#namespace)

#### Annotation Router
```
// CMS API
type CMSController struct {
    beego.Controller
}

func (c *CMSController) URLMapping() {
    c.Mapping("StaticBlock", c.StaticBlock)
    c.Mapping("AllBlock", c.AllBlock)
}

// @router /staticblock/:key [get]
func (this *CMSController) StaticBlock() {

}

// @router /all/:key [get]
func (this *CMSController) AllBlock() {
}
```
[Annotation Router](http://beego.me/docs/mvc/controller/router.md#annotations)

#### Automated API Document
Automated document is a very cool feature that I wish to have. Now it became real in Beego. As I said beego will not only boost the development of API but also make the API easy to use for the user.

The API document can be generated by annotations automatically and can be tested online.

For more information please check [Automated Document](http://beego.me/docs/advantage/docs.md)

#### config supports different Runmode

You can set configurations for different Runmode under their own sections. beego will take the configurations of current Runmode by default. For example:

    appname = beepkg
    httpaddr = "127.0.0.1"
    httpport = 9090
    runmode ="dev"
    autorender = false
    autorecover = false
    viewspath = "myview"

    [dev]
    httpport = 8080
    [prod]
    httpport = 8088
    [test]
    httpport = 8888

The configurations above set up httpport for dev, prod and test environment. beego will take httpport = 8080 for current runmode "dev".

#### Support Two Way Authentication for SSL

```
config := tls.Config{
    ClientAuth: tls.RequireAndVerifyClientCert,
    Certificates: []tls.Certificate{cert},
    ClientCAs: pool,
}
config.Rand = rand.Reader

beego.BeeApp.Server.TLSConfig = &config
```

#### beego.Run supports parameter

`beego.Run()` Run on `HttpPort` by default

`beego.Run(":8089")`

`beego.Run("127.0.0.1:8089")`

#### Increased XSRFKEY token from 15 characters to 32 characters.

#### Removed hot reload

#### Template function supports Config. Get Config value from Template easily.

    {{config returnType key defaultValue}}

    {{config "int" "httpport" 8080}}

#### httplib supports cookiejar. Thanks to curvesft

#### orm suports time format. If empty return nil other than 0000.00.00 Thanks to JessonChan

#### config module supports parsing a json array. Thanks to chrisport

### bug fix

- Fixed static folder infinite loop
- Fixed typo



# beego 1.2.0

Hi guys! After one month of hard work, we released the new awesome version 1.2.0. beego is the fastest Go framework in the latest [Web Framework Benchmarks](http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r9&hw=i7&test=json) already though our goal is to make beego the best and easiest framework to use. In this new release, we improved even more in both usability and performance which is closer to native Go.

### New Features:

#### 1. `namespace` Support

```
    beego.NewNamespace("/v1").
        Filter("before", auth).
        Get("/notallowed", func(ctx *context.Context) {
        ctx.Output.Body([]byte("notAllowed"))
    }).
        Router("/version", &AdminController{}, "get:ShowAPIVersion").
        Router("/changepassword", &UserController{}).
        Namespace(
        beego.NewNamespace("/shop").
            Filter("before", sentry).
            Get("/:id", func(ctx *context.Context) {
            ctx.Output.Body([]byte("notAllowed"))
        }))
```

The code above supports the URL requests below:

```
GET       /v1/notallowed
GET       /v1/version
GET       /v1/changepassword
POST      /v1/changepassword
GET       /v1/shop/123
```

`namespace` also supports pre-filters, conditions checking and unlimited nested `namespace`

#### 2. Supporting more flexible router modes

Custom functions from RESTful router

```
beego.Get(router, beego.FilterFunc)
beego.Post(router, beego.FilterFunc)
beego.Put(router, beego.FilterFunc)
beego.Head(router, beego.FilterFunc)
beego.Options(router, beego.FilterFunc)
beego.Delete(router, beego.FilterFunc)

beego.Get("/user", func(ctx *context.Context) {
    ctx.Output.Body([]byte("Get userlist"))
})
```

More flexible Handler

`beego.Handler(router, http.Handler)`

Integrating other services easily

```
import (
    "http"
    "github.com/gorilla/rpc"
    "github.com/gorilla/rpc/json"
)

func init() {
    s := rpc.NewServer()
    s.RegisterCodec(json.NewCodec(), "application/json")
    s.RegisterService(new(HelloService), "")
    beego.Handler("/rpc", s)
}
```

#### 3. Binding request parameters to object directly


For example: this request parameters

    ?id=123&isok=true&ft=1.2&ol[0]=1&ol[1]=2&ul[]=str&ul[]=array&user.Name=astaxie

```
var id int
ctx.Input.Bind(&id, "id")  //id ==123

var isok bool
ctx.Input.Bind(&isok, "isok")  //isok ==true

var ft float64
ctx.Input.Bind(&ft, "ft")  //ft ==1.2

ol := make([]int, 0, 2)
ctx.Input.Bind(&ol, "ol")  //ol ==[1 2]

ul := make([]string, 0, 2)
ctx.Input.Bind(&ul, "ul")  //ul ==[str array]

user struct{Name}
ctx.Input.Bind(&user, "user")  //user =={Name:"astaxie"}
```

#### 4. Optimized the form parsing flow and improved the performance

#### 5. Added more testcases

#### 6. Added links for admin monitoring module

#### 7. supporting saving struct into session

#### 8.httplib supports file upload interface

```
b:=httplib.Post("http://beego.me/")
b.Param("username","astaxie")
b.Param("password","123456")
b.PostFile("uploadfile1", "httplib.pdf")
b.PostFile("uploadfile2", "httplib.txt")
str, err := b.String()
if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
}
```
`httplib` also supports custom protocol version

#### 9. ORM supports all the unexport fields of struct

#### 10. Enable XSRF in controller level. XSRF can only be controlled in the whole project level. However, you may want to have more control for XSRF, so we let you control it in Prepare function in controller level. Default is true which means using the global setting.

```
func (a *AdminController) Prepare(){
       a.EnableXSRF = false
}
```

#### 11. controller supports ServeFormatted function which supports calling ServeJson or ServeXML based on the request's Accept

#### 12. session supports memcache engine

#### 13. The Download function of Context supports custom download file name

2. Fixed the bug of saving and parsing flash data
3. Fixed all the problems of `go vet`
4. Fixed the bug of ParseFormOrMulitForm

# beego 1.0 release
After four months code refactoring, we released the first stable version of Beego. We did a lot of refactoring and improved a lot in detail. Here is the list of the main improvements:

1. Modular design. Right now Beego is a light weight assembling framework with eight powerful stand alone modules including cache, config, logs, sessions, httplibs, toolbox, orm and context. It might have more in the future. You can use all of these stand alone modules in your other applications directly no matter itâ€™s web applications or any other applications such as web games and mobile games.

2. Supervisor module. In the real world engineering, after the deployment of the application, we need to do many kinds of statistics and analytics for the application such as QPS statistics, GC analytics, memory and CPU monitoring and so on. When the live issue happends we also want to debug and profile our application on live. All of these real world engineering features are included in Beego. You can enable the supervisor module in Beego and visit it from default port 8088.

3. Detailed document. We rewritten all the document. We improved the document based on many advices from the users. To make it communicate easier for different language speakers, now the comments of the document in each language are separated.

4. Demos. We provided three examples, chat room, url shortener and todo list. You can understand and use Beego easier and faster by learning the demos.

5. Redesigned Beego website. Nice people from Beego community helped Beego for logo design and website design.

6. More and more users. We listed our typical users in our homepage. They are all big companies and they are using Beego for their products already. Beego already tested by those live applications.

7. Growing active communities. There are more than 390 issues on github, more than 36 contributors and more than 700 commits. Google groups is also growing.

8. More and more applications in Beego. There are some open source applications as well. E.g.: CMS system: https://github.com/insionng/toropress and admin system: https://github.com/beego/admin

9. Powerful assistance tools. bee is used to assist the development of Beego applications. It can create, compile, package the Beego application easily.

released date: 2013-12-19
