# Configuration

Beego configuration file supports INI, XML, JSON, YAML. It uses INI format by default. It is flexible and easy to configure.

## The default configurations parsing

Beego will parse `conf/app.conf` file by default.

You can initialize many beego default variables in this file:

	appname = beepkg
	httpaddr = "127.0.0.1"
	httpport = 9090
	runmode ="dev"
	autorender = false
	autorecover = false
	viewspath = "myview"

These configurations will replace beego's default value.

You can also configure many values which your application needs, such as database connection:

	mysqluser = "root"
	mysqlpass = "rootpass"
	mysqlurls = "127.0.0.1"
	mysqldb   = "beego"

Then you can read these configurations like this:

	beego.AppConfig.String("mysqluser")
	beego.AppConfig.String("mysqlpass")
	beego.AppConfig.String("mysqlurls")
	beego.AppConfig.String("mysqldb")

AppConfig supports:

- Bool(key string) (bool, error)
- Int(key string) (int, error)
- Int64(key string) (int64, error)
- Float(key string) (float64, error)
- String(key string) string

### The Configurations for Different Environments

You can set configurations for different runmode under their own sections. Beego will take the configurations of current runmode by default. For example:

  appname = beepkg
  httpaddr = "127.0.0.1"
  httpport = 9090
  runmode ="dev"
  autorender = false
  autorecover = false
  viewspath = "myview"

  [dev]
  httpport = 8080
  [prod]
  httpport = 8088
  [test]
  httpport = 8888

The configurations above set up httpport for dev, prod and test environment. Beego will take httpport = 8080 for current runmode "dev".

### Beego default variables

Beego has many configurable variables. Let's have a look at these variables. It will help us to know how to use them in development. (You can configure and overwrite them in `conf/app.conf`. Case insensitive.):

* AppName

  Application name, Beego by default. It's project_name if the application is created by `bee new project_name`

* AppPath

  Application path. It will get the first parameter of the executed command by `os.Args[0]`. So you need to execute by full path if you are using supervisor to manage processes.

* AppConfigPath

  Application configuration file path. It is `conf/app.conf` by default.  You can change it to your own file.

* UseFcgi

  Enable fastcgi or not, false by default.

* MaxMemory

  Memory cache size for file uploading, `1 << 26`(64M) by default.

* FlashSeperator

  Flash data seperator，default is `BEEGOFLASH`

* StaticDir

  set the static file，default is `static`
 	1. one dir，the same as `beego.SetStaticPath("/download","download")`
