# Live Monitor

We talked about toolbox module before. It will listen `127.0.0.1:8088` by default when application is running. It can't be accessed from internet but you can visit it by other ways such as nginx proxy.

>>> For security reason it is recommend to block 8088 in firewall.

Monitor is disabled by default. You can enable it by setting bellow line in `conf/app.conf` file:

	EnableAdmin = true

Also you can change the port it listened:

	AdminHttpAddr = "localhost"
	AdminHttpPort = 8888

Open browser and visit `http://localhost:8088/` you will see `Welcome to Admin Dashboard`.

It's the first version now. We will keep on developing it.

## Requests statistics

Visit `http://localhost:8088/qps` you will see it:

## Performance profiling

There are several params for profiling. Visit `http://localhost:8088/prof` and with params below and you can get different information.

	request url like '/prof?command=lookup goroutine'
	the command have below types:
	1. lookup goroutine
	2. lookup heap
	3. lookup threadcreate
	4. lookup block
	5. start cpuprof
	6. stop cpuprof
	7. get memprof
	8. gc summary


## Healthcheck

You need to manually register the healthcheck logic to see the status of the healthcheck from `http://localhost:8088/healthcheck`

## Tasks

You can add task in your application and check the task status or trigger it manually.

- Check task status: `http://localhost:8088/task`
- Run task manually: `http://localhost:8088/runtask?taskname=task_name`

## Config Status

After the development of the application, we may also want to know the config when the application is running. beego's Monitor also provided this feature.

- Show all configurations: `http://localhost:8088/listconf?command=conf`
- Show all routers: `http://localhost:8088/listconf?command=router`
- Show all filters: `http://localhost:8088/listconf?command=filter`
